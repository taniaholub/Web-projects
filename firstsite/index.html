            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <ul>
                <h3> Who Is Billie Eilish?</h3>
                <li>Born and raised in Los Angeles, Billie Eilish was barely a teenager when her song "Ocean Eyes"
                    became a viral hit. She teamed with her brother, Finneas, to create the tracks for the breakout EP
                    Don't Smile at Me and the smash album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?, establishing the
                    artist as a global sensation and multi-time Grammy winner before the age of 20.</li>
                <h3>Early life and Family</h3>
                <li>Eilish was born on December 18, 2001, in Los Angeles, California. Her parents, Maggie Baird and
                    Patrick O’Connell, were longtime actors before joining their teenage daughter's professional team.
                    Eilish's full name is Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell. Her first name is in honor of her
                    maternal grandfather, William; the second was inspired by a conjoined twin her parents saw in a
                    documentary; and the third came from the insistence of her older brother, Finneas.

                    Raised in a two-bedroom house in Highland Park, where she and her brother were homeschooled, Eilish
                    was encouraged to pursue her interests in dance, gymnastics, horseback riding and especially music.
                    She learned to play the Beatles' "I Will" on the ukulele at age 6; joined Los Angeles Children's
                    Chorus at age 8; and began writing songs in earnest by age 11, her talents nurtured through her
                    mother's songwriting class. Eilish has said her first "real" song, "Fingers Crossed," was penned
                    around that time after watching an episode of The Walking Dead.</li>
                <h3>Brother Finneas</h3>
                <li>The elder sibling by four-and-a-half years, Finneas became his sister's indispensable collaborator,
                    co-writer and producer, the pair continuing to compose and record together from a bedroom in their
                    Highland Park home even after Eilish's emergence as a global phenomenon.
                    <q><em>Probably 75-80 percent of the songs are written with us sitting next to each other at a piano
                            or
                            with a guitar, singing a
                            melody together,</em></q> he told Variety in 2019. <q><em>It's like a relay race — we really
                            feel like
                            we both have to kill our portion of it to get to the finish line.</em></q>

                    Finneas, who released the solo EP Blood Harmony in October 2019, has also co-written and produced
                    tracks for other popular artists like Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez and Camila Cabello.
